# Capstone-Project
Currently, between 2 and 3 million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers occur globally each year (WHO, 2017). Skin cancer is one type of cancer that can cause death for many people. Because of this, an application is needed to easily detect skin cancer early that the cancer can be handled with more quickly. Besides, consultations with dermatologists have better prognosis (AvilÃ©s-Izquierdo et. al., 2016). Due to that, we built an early skin cancer detection application with dermatologist consultation.

Tech Stack:
- Kotlin, Android Studio
- Firebase Firestore & Auth
- TensorFlow Lite --> Client-Side Deployment on the previous build version.
